Implement void process(const char str[], char outstr[]) function which standardizes English name. The standardized name has the following features:

1. The first character of each word must be uppercase. The remaining characters of each word must be lowercase.

2. Only contains characters in English alphabet.

3. There are no consecutive space characters and there is no space character at the beginning/end of the name
